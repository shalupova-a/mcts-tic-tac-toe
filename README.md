# mcts-tic-tac-toe

Attempting to improve selection step of MCTS algorithm by implementing sufficieny threshold and moving average return function methods (source: http://www.ru.is/~yngvi/pdf/GudmundssonB11.pdf)

* Had to pip install pygame, numpy, and matplotlib modules to play*  

Code forked from: https://github.com/hayoung-kim/mcts-tic-tac-toe

solve tic tac toe (3x3) problem using vanila `mcts`. It was made for the purpose of studying the concept of mcts.

### Requirement

- pygame



### How to play

```
python play.py
```



### Implement detail

`selection`: UCT algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)

`expansion`: create all possible node from state

`simulation`: randomly play simulation(=random roll-out policy). This simulation method lower the performance. 

`backprop`: back propagate simulation result.
